# Migrating to 2.0

This tutorial will guide you through the process of updating your app from using the `python slackclient v1.x` to using the updated client, v2.0.

> **NOTE**: It will not be possible to just update your Python SlackClient library without code changes. We have changed a large amount of the client and you should only upgrade once you have fully tested it in your development environment. Please be sure to pin your module for the Python slackclient to `1.3.1` if you don't wish to upgrade yet. If you do experience issues, you will be able to install the previous version by using `pip install slackclient==1.3.1` or whichever version of the library you were using.

## Import changes
---
 The goal of this project is to provide a set of tools that ease the creation of Python Slack apps. To better align with this goal weâ€™re renaming the main module to `slack`. From `slack` developers can import various tools. 
```Python
# Before:
# import slackclient

# After:
from slack import WebClient
```
</br>

## RTM Client API Changes:
---
The RTM client has been completely redesigned please see our [README][readme] for a full breakdown of how to implement it in the v2 of our client.

**We no longer store any team data.**: In the current 1.x version of the client we store some channel and user information internally on [`Server.py`](https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient/blob/master/slackclient/server.py) in `client`. This data will now be available in the open event for consumption. Developers are then free to store any information they choose. Here's an example:
```Python
# Retrieving the team domain.
# Before:
# team_domain = client.server.login_data["team"]["domain"]

# After:
def get_team_data(data):
    team_domain = data['team']['domain']
rtm_client.on(event='open', callback=get_team_data)
```
</br>

## Web Client API Changes:
---
**Token refresh removed**: 

This feature originally shipped as a part of Workspace Tokens. Since we're [heading in a new direction](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/the-latest-with-app-tokens-fe878d44130c) it's safe to remove this, along with any related attributes stored on the client.
- ~refresh_token~
- ~token_update_callback~
- ~client_id~
- ~client_secret~

**`#api_call()`**:

- `timeout` param has been removed. Timeout is passed at the client level now.
- `kwargs` param has been removed. You must specify where the data you pass belongs in the request. e.g. 'data' vs 'params' vs 'files'...etc
```Python
# Before:
# from slackclient import SlackClient
#
# client = SlackClient(os.environ["SLACK_API_TOKEN"])
# client.api_call('chat.postMessage',
#     timeout=30,
#     channel='C0123456',
#     text="Hi!")

# After:

import slack

client = slack.WebClient(os.environ["SLACK_API_TOKEN"], timeout=30)
client.api_call('chat.postMessage', json={
    'channel': 'C0123456',
    'text': 'Hi!'})

# Note: The SlackAPIMixin allows you to write it like this.
client.chat_postMessage(
    channel='C0123456',
    text='Hi!')
```

**SlackAPIMixin**: The Slack API mixin provides built-in methods for Slack's Web API. These methods act as helpers enabling you to focus less on how the request is constructed. Here are a few things that this mixin provides:
- Basic information about each method through the docstring.
- Easy File Uploads: You can now pass in the location of a file and the library will handle opening and retrieving the file object to be transmitted.
- Token type validation: This gives you better error messaging when you're attempting to consume an api method that your token doesn't have access to.
- Constructs requests using Slack's preferred HTTP methods and content-types.
