[tox]
; you probably don't have all of these python versions on your machine. when you invoke tox, you should pick an
; environment that you have (e.g. `tox -e py27,py36,flake8`).
; for quality analysis, use `tox -e flake8` or just `flake8 slackclient`
; to build the docs, use `tox -e docs`

    ; `--cov-report=html:cov_html`: suppress terminal output, html report in `cov_html/`, populate `.coverage/`
    ; `--cov=slackclient`: name project

    ; `coverage` utility has configuration in `.coveragerc`
    ;  CI systems use their own build matricies and virtualenvs and don't need tox. therefore tox shouldn't be used
