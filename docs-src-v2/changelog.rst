To everyone who's opened, commented or reacted to an issue; this project is better because of you!
Thank you for helping the Slack community!

v2.0.0 (2019-04-29)
-------------------
`Original RFC <https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient/issues/384>`_

`v2 PR <https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient/pull/394>`_

**New Features**

1. Client Decomposition: We’ve split the client into two.

  a. WebClient: A HTTP client focused on Slack's Web API.
  b. RTMClient: A websocket client focused on Slack's RTM API.

2. RTMClient: Completely redesigned, this client allows you to link your application's callbacks to corresponding Slack events.
3. WebClient: The WebClient now provides built-in methods for Slack's Web API. These methods act as helpers enabling you to focus less on how the request is constructed. Here are a few things that this provides:

  a. Basic information about each method through the docstring.
  b. Easy File Uploads: You can now pass in the location of a file and the library will handle opening and retrieving the file object to be transmitted.
  c. Token type validation: This gives you better error messaging when you're attempting to consume an api method that your token doesn't have access to.
  d. Constructs requests using Slack's preferred HTTP methods and content-types.

**Breaking Changes:**
If you're migrating from v1.x of slackclient to v2.x, Please follow our migration guide to ensure your app continues working after updating.

`Check out the Migration Guide here! <https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient/wiki/Migrating-to-2.x>`_

**Thank you!**
This release would not have been possible without the support of our community. Thank you to everyone who’s contributed to this release.
