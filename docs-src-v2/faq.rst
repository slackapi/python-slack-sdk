I cannot install slackclient...
*********************************

We recommend using `virtualenv (venv) <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_ to set up your Python runtime.

.. code-block:: bash

  # Create a dedicated virtual env for running your Python scripts
  python -m venv env

  # Run env\Scripts\activate on Windows OS
  source env/bin/activate

  # Install slackclient PyPI package
  pip install "slackclient>=2.0"

  # Set your token as an env variable (`set` command for Windows OS)
  export SLACK_API_TOKEN=xoxb-***

Then, verify the following code works on the Python REPL (you can start it by just ``python``).

.. code-block:: python

  import os
  import logging
  from slack import WebClient
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
  client = WebClient(token=os.environ["SLACK_API_TOKEN"])
  res = client.api_test()


If you encounter an error saying ``AttributeError: module 'slack' has no attribute 'WebClient'``, run ``pip list``. If you find both ``slackclient`` and ``slack`` in the output, try removing ``slack`` by ``pip uninstall slack`` and reinstalling ``slackclient``.

Should I go with run_async?
****************************

For most cases, we recommend going with ``run_async=False`` mode. So, the default is ``False``.

If your application turns ``run_async`` on, the app should follow right and efficient ways to use `asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_'s non-blocking event loops and `aiohttp <https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/>`_. Also, consider using async frameworks and their appropriate runtime. Running event loops along with Flask or similar may not be a good fit.

If you have to simultaneously run ``WebClient`` with ``run_async=True`` outside an event loop for some reason, sharing a single ``WebClient`` instance doesn't work for you. Create an instance every time you run the code. The ``run_async=False`` mode doesn't have such issues.

I found a bug!
******************

That's great! Thank you. Let us know on the `Issue Tracker`_. If you're feeling particularly ambitious, why not submit a `pull request`_ with a bug fix?

There's a feature missing!
*******************************

There's always something more that could be added! You can let us know in the `Issue Tracker`_ to start a discussion around the proposed feature, that's a good start. If you're feeling particularly ambitious, why not write the feature yourself, and submit a `pull request`_! We love feedback and we love help and we don't bite. Much.

How do I contribute?
*********************************

What an excellent question. First of all, please have a look at our general `contributing guidelines`_.

All done? Great! While we're super excited to incorporate your new feature, there are a couple of things we want to make sure you've given thought to.

- Please write unit tests for your new code. But don't **just** aim to increase the test coverage, rather, we expect you
  to have written **thoughtful** tests that ensure your new feature will continue to work as expected, and to help future
  contributors to ensure they don't break it!

- Please document your new feature. Think about **concrete use cases** for your feature, and add a section to the
  appropriate document, including a **complete** sample program that demonstrates your feature. Don't forget to update
  the changelog in ``changelog.rst``!

Including these two items with your pull request will totally make our dayâ€”and, more importantly, your future users' days!

On that note...

How do I compile the documentation?
*************************************

This project's documentation is generated with `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_. If you are editing one of the many reStructuredText files in the ``docs-src`` folder, you'll need to rebuild the documentation. It is recommended to run the following steps inside a ``virtualenv`` environment.

.. code-block:: bash

  tox -e docs

Do be sure to add the ``docs`` folder and its contents to your pull request!


.. include:: metadata.rst
