# Building a message
The code for this step is available [here](/tutorial/PythOnBoardingBot/onboarding_tutorial.py).

> üí° **[Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit)** is a new UI framework that offers you more control and flexibility when building messages for Slack. Comprised of "blocks," stackable bits of message UI, you can customize the order and appearance of information delivered by your app in Slack. Using the **[Block Kit Builder](https://api.slack.com/tools/block-kit-builder)** you can shuffle and stack blocks to quickly prototype app messages on Slack. When you're ready, we'll provide the message payload so all you have to do is copy and paste it into your app's code.

We're going to be using Block Kit to build our onboarding tutorial messages.

With Block Kit, we can create a message in Slack that looks like this:

By sending the following json payload:
```Python
{
    "channel": "D0123456",
    "username": "pythonboardingbot",
    "icon_emoji": ":robot_face:",
    "blocks": [
        {
            "type": "section",
            "text": {
                "type": "mrkdwn",
                "text": "Welcome to Slack! :wave: We're so glad you're here. :blush:\n\n*Get started by completing the steps below:*",
            },
        },
        {"type": "divider"},
        {
            "type": "section",
            "text": {
                "type": "mrkdwn",
                "text": ":white_large_square: *Add an emoji reaction to this message* :thinking_face:\nYou can quickly respond to any message on Slack with an emoji reaction. Reactions can be used for any purpose: voting, checking off to-do items, showing excitement.",
            },
        },
        {
            "type": "context",
            "elements": [
                {
                    "type": "mrkdwn",
                    "text": " :information_source: *<https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/206870317-Emoji-reactions|Learn How to Use Emoji Reactions>*",
                }
            ],
        },
        {"type": "divider"},
        {
            "type": "section",
            "text": {
                "type": "mrkdwn",
                "text": ":white_large_square: *Pin this message* :round_pushpin:\nImportant messages and files can be pinned to the details pane in any channel or direct message, including group messages, for easy reference.",
            },
        },
        {
            "type": "context",
            "elements": [
                {
                    "type": "mrkdwn",
                    "text": " :information_source: *<https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205239997-Pinning-messages-and-files|Learn How to Pin a Message>*",
                }
            ],
        },
    ],
}
```

To make this simpler, more pleasant and more productive we'll create a class that's responsible for building it. We'll also store the state of which tasks were completed so that it's easy to update existing messages.
- Create a file called `onboarding_tutorial.py`
- üèÅAdd the following code into it:
```Python
class OnboardingTutorial:
    """Constructs the onboarding message and stores the state of which tasks were completed."""

    WELCOME_BLOCK = {
        "type": "section",

                "Welcome to Slack! :wave: We're so glad you're here. :blush:\n\n"
