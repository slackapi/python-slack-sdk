# Build a Slack app in less than 10 minutes!

Welcome to the Slack app tutorial: **PythOnBoardingBot**.

This tutorial serves as a walkthrough guide and example of the types of Slack apps you can build with Slack's Python SDK, python-slackclient. We'll cover all the basic steps you'll need to have a fully functioning app.

## What is PythOnBoardingBot?

PythOnBoardingBot is designed to greet new users on your team and introduce them to some nifty features in Slack.

When a user first joins a team it'll send you a message with the following tasks that you must complete.
- Pin a message to the channel.
- React to a message.
- Message was shared in DM.
As you complete each task you'll see the message update. Once the final task is completed. You'll see the message update with a congradulations message.

## What you'll need before you get started:

0. A Slack team.
Before anything else you'll need a Slack team. You can [Sign into an existing Slack workspace](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212681477-Sign-in-to-Slack) or you can [create a new Slack workspace](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/206845317-Create-a-Slack-workspace) to test your app first.

1. A terminal with Python 3.6+ installed.
Check your installation by running the following command in your terminal:
```
$ python3 --version
-> Python 3.6.7
```

You'll need to install Python 3.6 if you receive the following error:
```
-> bash: python3: command not found
```

Note: You should probably use pyenv to install Python 3. See [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) and [pyenv-install](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer) for details.

Create a new project folder and a virtual environment.
```
$ mkdir PythOnBoardingBot && cd PythOnBoardingBot
$ python3 -m venv env/
$ source env/bin/activate
```

2. A text editor of your choice.
Open up your new project folder "PythOnBoardingBot" in your text editor.
