# Running your app
### Set App Credentials
Before you can run your app you need to put your bot token into the environment.

**Note:** This is the same token you copied at the end of [Step 1](/tutorial/01-creating-the-slack-app.md#add-a-bot-user).

- Add this token to your environment variables:
```
$ export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN='xoxb-XXXXXXXXXXXX-xxxxxxxxxxxx-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
```

- 🏁Run your app
```
$ python3 app.py
-> The Websocket connection has been opened.
```

### 🎉 That's it. Congradulations! You've just built a Slack app. 🤖
To demo the app, simply send the bot a message that says "start".
