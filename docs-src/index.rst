==============================================
|product_name|
==============================================

Whether you're building a custom app for your team, or integrating a third party
service into your Slack workflows, |product_name| allows you to leverage the flexibility
of Python to get your project up and running as quickly as possible.

Requirements and Installation
******************************

|product_name| currently works with Python 2.7 (watch for Python 3 support in the future), and requires `PyPI` to install
dependencies. Of course, since you probably installed this module with `PyPI`, this is not a problem.

We recommend using `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ to install |product_name|

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install slackclient

Of course, if you prefer doing things the hard way, you can always implement |product_name|
by pulling down the source code directly into your project:

.. code-block:: bash

	git clone https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient.git
	pip install -r requirements.txt
