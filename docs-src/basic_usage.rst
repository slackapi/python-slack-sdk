==============================================
Basic Usage
==============================================
The Slack Web API allows you to build applications that interact with Slack in more complex ways than the integrations
we provide out of the box.

This package is a modular wrapper designed to make Slack `Web API`_ calls simpler and easier for your
app. Provided below are examples of how to interact with commonly used API endpoints, but this is by no means
a complete list. Review the full list of available methods `here <https://api.slack.com/methods>`_.

See :ref:`Tokens & Authentication <handling-tokens>` for API token handling best practices.

--------

Sending a message
-----------------------
The primary use of Slack is sending messages. Whether you're sending a message
to a user or to a channel, this method handles both.

To send a message to a channel, use the channel's ID. For IMs, use the user's ID.
::

  from slackclient import SlackClient

  slack_token = os.environ["SLACK_API_TOKEN"]
  sc = SlackClient(slack_token)

  sc.api_call(
    "chat.postMessage",
    channel="#python",
    text="Hello from Python! :tada:"
  )

There are some unique options specific to sending IMs, so be sure to read the **channels**
section of the `chat.postMessage <https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage#channels>`_
page for a full list of formatting and authorship options.

--------

Updating the content of a message
----------------------------------
Let's say you have a bot which posts the status of a request. When that request
is updated, you'll want to update the message to reflect it's state. Or your user
might want to fix a typo or change some wording. This is how you'll make those changes.
::

  from slackclient import SlackClient

  slack_token = os.environ["SLACK_API_TOKEN"]
  sc = SlackClient(slack_token)

  sc.api_call(
    "chat.update",
    ts="1476746830.000003",
    channel="C0XXXXXX",
    text="Hello from Python! :tada:"
  )

See `chat.update <https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.update>`_ for formatting options
and some special considerations when calling this with a bot user.

--------

Deleting a message
-------------------
Sometimes you need to delete things.
::

  from slackclient import SlackClient

  slack_token = os.environ["SLACK_API_TOKEN"]
  sc = SlackClient(slack_token)

  sc.api_call(
    "chat.delete",
    channel="C0XXXXXX",
    ts="1476745373.000002"
  )

See `chat.delete <https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.delete>`_ for more info.

--------

Adding or removing an emoji reaction
---------------------------------------
You can quickly respond to any message on Slack with an emoji reaction. Reactions
can be used for any purpose: voting, checking off to-do items, showing excitement â€” and just for fun.

This method adds a reaction (emoji) to an item (``file``, ``file comment``, ``channel message``, ``group message``, or ``direct message``). One of file, file_comment, or the combination of channel and timestamp must be specified.
::

  from slackclient import SlackClient

  slack_token = os.environ["SLACK_API_TOKEN"]
  sc = SlackClient(slack_token)

  sc.api_call(
    "reactions.add",
    channel="C0XXXXXXX",
    name="thumbsup",
    timestamp="1234567890.123456"
  )

Removing an emoji reaction is basically the same format, but you'll use ``reactions.remove`` instead of ``reactions.add``
::

  sc.api_call(
    "reactions.remove",
    channel="C0XXXXXXX",
    name="thumbsup",
    timestamp="1234567890.123456"
  )


See `reactions.add <https://api.slack.com/methods/reactions.add>`_ and `reactions.remove <https://api.slack.com/methods/reactions.remove>`_ for more info.

--------

Getting a list of channels
---------------------------
At some point, you'll want to find out what channels are available to your app. This is how you get that list.

**Note:** This call requires the ``channels:read`` scope.
::

  from slackclient import SlackClient

  slack_token = os.environ["SLACK_API_TOKEN"]
  sc = SlackClient(slack_token)

  sc.api_call("channels.list")

Archived channels are included by default. You can exclude them by passing ``exclude_archived=1`` to your request.

::

  from slackclient import SlackClient

  slack_token = os.environ["SLACK_API_TOKEN"]
  sc = SlackClient(slack_token)

  sc.api_call(
    "channels.list",
    exclude_archived=1
  )

See `channels.list <https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.list>`_ for more info.

--------

Getting a channel's info
-------------------------
Once you have the ID for a specific channel, you can fetch information about that channel.
::

  from slackclient import SlackClient

  slack_token = os.environ["SLACK_API_TOKEN"]
  sc = SlackClient(slack_token)

  sc.api_call(
    "channels.info",
    channel="C0XXXXXXX"
  )

See `channels.info <https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.info>`_ for more info.

--------

Joining a channel
------------------
::

  from slackclient import SlackClient

  slack_token = os.environ["SLACK_API_TOKEN"]
  sc = SlackClient(slack_token)

  sc.api_call(
    "channels.join",
    channel="C0XXXXXXY"
  )

If you are already in the channel, the response is slightly different.
``already_in_channel`` will be true, and a limited ``channel`` object will be returned.

See `channels.join <https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.join>`_ for more info.

--------

Leaving a channel
------------------
Maybe you've finished up all the business you had in a channel, or maybe you
joined one by accident. This is how you leave a channel.
::

  from slackclient import SlackClient

  slack_token = os.environ["SLACK_API_TOKEN"]
  sc = SlackClient(slack_token)

  sc.api_call(
    "channels.leave",
    channel="C0XXXXXXX"
  )

See `channels.leave <https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.leave>`_ for more info.

--------

Get a list of team members
------------------------------
::

  from slackclient import SlackClient

  slack_token = os.environ["SLACK_API_TOKEN"]
  sc = SlackClient(slack_token)

  sc.api_call("users.list")

See `users.list <https://api.slack.com/methods/users.list>`_ for more info.
